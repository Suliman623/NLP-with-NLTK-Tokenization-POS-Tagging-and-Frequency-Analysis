# NLP-with-NLTK-Tokenization-POS-Tagging-and-Frequency-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. It covers essential text processing tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, and frequency distribution analysis. The goal is to extract useful linguistic insights from text data.

## Features
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into sentences and words.
- **POS Tagging:** Identifying parts of speech for each token.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Finding the most common words in a text.
- **Visualization:** Displaying frequency distribution using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NLTK (for NLP tasks)
  - Regular Expressions (for text processing)
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib
```

Additionally, download the required NLTK datasets:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Usage
1. Load a text file or input text manually.
2. Apply tokenization to split sentences and words.
3. Use POS tagging to identify the grammatical category of words.
4. Perform frequency distribution analysis to find commonly used words.
5. Visualize results using bar plots.

## Example Output
- List of tokenized words and sentences.
- POS-tagged words.
- A bar chart showing word frequency.

## Applications
This project is useful for:
- Text preprocessing in Machine Learning and NLP applications.
- Extracting key insights from large text corpora.
- Building foundational NLP tools for chatbots and search engines.

## Future Improvements
- Expand to Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Include sentiment analysis.
- Integrate a web-based visualization dashboard.
